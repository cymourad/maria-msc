                <div class="help-text">
                    Consider whether the outcome was assessed using a method that would correctly capture the outcome of interest. For example, administrative databases might use codes that do not correctly identify all cases of the outcome, or measurement methods might lack validation in the population being studied.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Differential measurement of outcomes can occur when different methods or approaches are used to assess outcomes in different intervention groups. For example, more frequent tests or examinations in one group can lead to increased detection of outcomes.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Knowledge of the intervention received could influence how the outcome is assessed when there is judgement involved. The importance of blinding of outcome assessors will depend on how much judgement is involved in determining outcomes.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Even if outcome assessors were aware of the intervention received, this question asks whether such knowledge could have influenced their assessment. For example, knowledge of the intervention might have little impact on assessment of an objective outcome such as death but could influence assessment of a subjective outcome such as quality of life.

                    Systematic error (bias) can occur if there are systematic differences between intervention groups in how outcomes are ascertained. Consider whether any systematic error in outcome measurement is likely to be different for participants receiving different interventions.
