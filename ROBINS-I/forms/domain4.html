                <div class="help-text">
                    When interest focuses on the effect of assignment to intervention, bias only arises if there are deviations that arose because the study was done in an experimental context. Examples include controlled trials that use methods other than randomization to allocate interventions, or studies where participants self-select to receive an intervention for the purposes of comparison.

                <div class="help-text">
                    This refers to deviations that would not happen outside the experimental context. For example, participants in the comparator group might feel unlucky and seek the intervention. Answer 'Y' or 'PY' only if there is evidence that the processes of recruiting and engaging with study participants led to non-adherence that would not occur outside the study context.

            <label for="personnelDeviation">4.3 Did study personnel consciously or unconsciously undermine implementation of the intended interventions?
                <div class="help-text">
                    This refers to situations where study personnel undermine implementation in ways that would not happen outside the study context. Answer 'Y' or 'PY' only if there is evidence that actions of study personnel, driven by conscious or unconscious biases, led to failure to implement the specified intervention strategies in ways that would not occur outside the study.
