                    Note that this question does not address situations in which follow-up time is split according to intervention received. Answer 'SY' if the impact of including participants in the comparator group until they fulfilled the definition of the intervention was likely to be substantial.

                    Information that was collected after the interventions started may be influenced by the outcome or the risk of the outcome. Answer 'Y' or 'PY' if information was collected directly from records of prescriptions. Answer 'N' or 'PN' if participants were asked to recall past interventions.

                <div class="help-text">
                    For example, if records of receipt of an intervention are destroyed if a participant dies (leading to misclassification of that participant into the comparator group) then analyses investigating the effect of the intervention on mortality will be biased. Answer 'SY' if the impact of knowledge of the outcome or risk of bias outcome was likely to be substantial.

            <label for="classifiedCorrectly">2.5 Was intervention status classified correctly for all, or nearly all, participants?
                <div class="help-text">
                    This relates to non-differential misclassification of intervention status. Criteria for considering individuals to have received each intervention should be clear and explicit. "Nearly all" should be interpreted as "enough to be confident of the findings", typically 95% of participants. Misclassification errors usually bias the result towards the null.
