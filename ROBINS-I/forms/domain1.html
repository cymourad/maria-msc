                <div class="help-text">
                    A confounding factor is a prognostic factor that predicts the interventions received. Important confounding factors are those that have the potential to introduce material bias into an estimated effect. Consider factors that are expected to have strong associations with both the intervention and the outcome.

            <label for="confoundersAppropriatelyMeasured">1.2 Was the analysis based on splitting participants' follow up time according to intervention received?
                <div class="help-text">
                    This question helps determine if time-varying confounding needs to be examined. If participants could switch between intervention groups, then associations between intervention and outcome may be biased by time-varying confounding. For example, in a study of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on AIDS rates, if CD4 counts during follow-up influenced the decision to start ART, CD4 count was a time-varying confounder.

                <div class="help-text">
                    This question helps assess if there is time-varying confounding that needs to be addressed in the analysis. Consider whether changes in intervention status during follow-up were influenced by factors that also predict the outcome.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Consider whether the method of analysis was adequate to control for important confounding factors. Appropriate methods might include regression adjustment, stratification, matching, weighting, or instrumental variable methods. The analysis should control for both baseline and time-varying confounding if relevant.
