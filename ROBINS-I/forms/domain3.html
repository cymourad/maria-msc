                <div class="help-text">
                    Using events or measurements that occurred after the start of follow up to assign participants to groups may lead to some participants having a period of 'immortal time' during which the outcome cannot occur. Examples include interventions defined as receipt of a minimum number of prescriptions or eligibility followed by receipt of a surgical intervention.

                <div class="help-text">
                    In this situation, participants who would have received the intervention but experienced an outcome event soon after the start of follow up are more likely to be excluded, leading to immortal time bias.

                <div class="help-text">
                    If participants are not followed from the start of the intervention then a period of follow up has been excluded, and individuals who experienced the outcome soon after intervention will be missing from analyses. This problem may occur when prevalent, rather than new (incident), users of the intervention are included in analyses. If the comparison group is "no intervention" then follow up can start at any point at which participants remain eligible to start the intervention.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Consider the effect of intervention (for example, rate ratio) that is estimated by the result being assessed. If the effect varies over time the estimate based on follow up from the start of intervention will differ from the effect restricted to later follow up.

                <div class="help-text">
                    Selection bias occurs when selection is related to an effect of either intervention or a cause of intervention and an effect of either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This domain does not address exclusion because of missing data.
